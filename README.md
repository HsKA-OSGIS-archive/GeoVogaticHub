# About the application
OpenLayers3 is an open source JavaScript library which allows people to load, display and render maps and vector layers in a web browser, similar to Google maps and Bing maps. 
By default, styling options for vector layers are set, and so this application was built to provide users with options to style a vector layer in different ways. This is accomplished by first allowing vector files to be loaded and displayed by dragging and dropping over the web interface, and secondly, providing the user with options to change style properties such as colour, size, line/border width and transparency.

# Data 
Any vector layer (points, lines and polygons), in GeoJSON and GML format are accepted by this application, however, GeoJSON vector files work best. 
A link to download sample data files has been provided on the upper right corner of the page.

# Layout and Procedure
A vector layer must be dropped over the map interface only. 
A button appears at the bottom of the map which when clicked opens a styling interface below it. 
Options are given to style the layer as desired. 
The layer can be deleted by clicking on the ‘X’ located at the top right corner of every button.
A help button has been provided at the bottom right corner which gives further information.
